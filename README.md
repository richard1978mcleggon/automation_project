Training
========
I am using this project to explain data driven framework capabilities. Frankly, cucumber already implements scenario
outline through which we can pass data tables (can pass without scenario outline too). This project also parses
other file formats like EXCEL, YML....
Data-driven framework by itself in a silo is not a complete solution, it is just a capability and we would have to talk
about other pieces of framework like modularization, page-objects etc.
Please visit www.seleniumframework.com for complete information.
